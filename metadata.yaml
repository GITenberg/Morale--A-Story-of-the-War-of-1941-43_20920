description: Written before the outbreak of World War II, this remarkable story imagines
  a military conflict in which a weapon of unprecedented power and destructiveness
  is unleashed -- but this time, it's an enemy of the U.S. that has the upper hand.
  With entire cities swept off the map in a matter of seconds, will the country be
  able to fight back?
